NeuralNetworkClass
==================

Neural Network Class in C++ using Eigen Library.

The input and Output vector matrix are to be fed column wise.

Example suppose you have to train for XOR then

Select Input {0, 0, 1, 1;
              0, 1, 0, 1}

And Output as {0, 1, 1, 0}

Have a look at main.cpp to see the example case.
